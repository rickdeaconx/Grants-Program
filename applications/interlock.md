## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Please provide the following:

Interlock is decentralized, enterprise-grade security for everyone.

Interlock's AI-powered threat detection prevents attacks like phishing and scams in the browser while incentivizing users to share anonymous security data, which is sold as threat intelligence. Threat intelligence powers the internets security. 

Interlock is built on Aleph Zero, a substrate blockchain and parachain partner. 

The goal of Interlock is to make the web safer for everyone using the community and incentives that Web3 provides.

The founder(Rick Deacon) has been in cybersecurity for over 15 years, has taken Web2 cybersecurity products to market, and is a YC alum. All 9 of Interlock's full-time team are ex-startup and ex-security, and we know the problems in Web2 are even worse in Web3. Our goal is to fix that. Interlock makes web safer for everyone using the community and incentives that only Web3 has.

### Project Details


Interlock has 4 live products:
- ThreatSlayer(browser extension that blocks attacks in real-time, soon to be enabled with blockchain rewards on Aleph Zero)
- Bouncer(Discord bot that blocks malicious links in real-time, soon to be enabled with blockchain rewards on Aleph Zero)
- Autocrat(API that allows Interlock AI threat detection to integrate directly into wallets and projects)
- Snap(MetaMask snap to warn on malicious wallets)

We are currently building out our smart contracts on Aleph Zero for our ILOCK token.

All of our code, including smart contract code, is available on our GitHub: https://github.com/interlock-network/

Our GitHub also links directly to our whitepaper.

ThreatSlayer(beta), which is our flagship product, can be tested immediately: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/threatslayer/mgcmocglffknmbhhfjihifeldhghihpj/related?hl=en&authuser=1


### Ecosystem Fit

Interlock fits into the ecosystem to extend security to individuals and bring more security to any projects building on Polkadot, Aleph Zero, or otherwise. Our goal is protect people from wallet drainers, phishing, scams, and more. EVERYONE in Web3 NEEDS better security. Billions of dollars worth of assets were lost the past 2 years in Web3.

In the future, we will launch more ecosystem products, starting with a direct integration into Aleph Zero's future wallet. We also plan to integrate into dApps and wallets further.

Our audience is anyone with a browser, but we're starting with Aleph Zero users.

Currently there are no directly similar products in the Polkadot/tangential ecosystem.

## Future Plans

Our goal is become a defacto for Web3 security. Our current products, soon to be blockchain enabled with the SCs above, will begin our marketing efforts to grow our userbase alongside our partner, Aleph Zero. They are comarketing with us and fully supporting our launch as well. 

The efforts to push that will grow our userbase, ultimately landing us more consumer users and creating more valuable security data.
That security data is key to our B2B revenue, which will launch late 2023.
